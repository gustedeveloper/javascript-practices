/* Given the existing code below, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?

var a = "3";
var b = "8";

So that the variable a holds the value "8".
And the variable b holds the value "3".
When the code is run, it should output:

a is 8

b is 3

Do NOT change any of the existing code.
You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.
You should NOT redeclare the variables a and b.

Hint: Use this code playground to run your code and see if it matches your expectations.
Hint: The solution is just 3 lines of code. */
